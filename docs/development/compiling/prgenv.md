This page will give you an overview of the Cray programming environment that is
available on LUMI. It starts with a presentation of the [compiler suites][1]
and [compiler wrappers][2] that you can use to compile your C, C++ or Fortran
code. Finally, some basic information on how to compile an [MPI][3] or
[OpenMP][4] program is given.

!!! Warning
    If you are using the [LUMI software stacks](../../runjobs/lumi_env/softwarestacks.md), it's highly recommended to only use the [EasyBuild toolchains of the programming environments](../../software/installing/easybuild.md#toolchains-on-cray), i.e. `cpe*` instead of `PrgEnv-*`. 


## Compiler Suites

On LUMI, the different compiler suites are accessible using module collections.
These collections load the appropriates modules to use one of the supported
programming environments for LUMI.


### Switching compiler suites

The compiler collections are accessible through [modules][modules] and in
particular, the `module load` command:

```bash
$ module load PrgEnv-<name>
```

where `<name>` is the name of the compiler suite. There are 3 collections
available on LUMI. The default collection is Cray.

|      | Description                   | Module collection |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| CCE  | Cray Compiling Environment    | `PrgEnv-cray`     |
| GCC  | GNU Compiler Collection       | `PrgEnv-gnu`      |
| AOCC | AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler | `PrgEnv-aocc`     |

For example, if you want to use the GNUâ€™s compiler collection:

```bash
$ module load PrgEnv-gnu
```

After you have loaded a programming environment, the [compiler wrappers][2]
(`cc`, `CC` and `ftn`) are available.

??? Bug "PrgEnv-aocc broken in 21.08 and 21.12"
    The ``PrgEnv-aocc`` module does not work correctly in the 21.08 and 21.12
    releases of the Cray programming environment. This is due to different
    reasons. The ``aocc/3.0.0`` module (used as the default version of AOCC in
    the 21.08 release) is broken since the compilers themselves are not
    installed. The ``aocc/3.1.0`` module has a bug in the code of the module.
    This has been fixed in later releases of the Crey programming environment
    so that problem will be solved when those releases are installed. Due to
    the way the installation of the Cray programming environment works, it is
    currently not possible for us to correct the module by hand.

### Changing compiler versions

If the default compiler version does not suit you, you can change the version
after having a loaded a programming environment. This operation is performed
using the `module swap` command.

```bash
$ module swap <compiler> <compiler>/<version>
```

where `<compiler>` is the name of the compiler module for the loaded
programming environment and `<version>` the version you want to use. For
example

=== "CCE"

    ```bash
    $ module swap cce cce/11.0.2
    ```

=== "GNU"

    ```bash
    $ module swap gcc gcc/10.2.0
    ```

## Compiler Wrappers

The module collection provides wrappers to the C, C++ and Fortran compilers. The
command used to invoke these wrappers are listed below.

- `cc`: C compiler
- `CC`: C++ compiler
- `ftn`: Fortran compiler

No matter which vendor's compiler module is loaded, always use one of the above
commands to invoke the compiler. Using these wrappers will invoke the
underlying compiler according to the [compiler suite][1] that is loaded in the
environment. For some libraries, the appropriate option for the linking will
also be included. See [here][2.2] for more information.

!!! note "About MPI Wrappers"
    The Cray compiler wrappers replace other wrappers commonly found on HPC
    systems like the `mpicc`, `mpic++` and `mpif90` wrappers. You don't need to
    use these wrappers to compile an MPI code on LUMI. See [here][3].

Below are examples on how to use the wrappers for the different programming
languages.

=== "C"

    ```bash
    $ cc -c source1.c
    $ cc -c source2.c
    $ cc source1.o source2.o -o myprogram 
    ```

=== "C++"

    ```bash
    $ CC -c source1.cpp
    $ CC -c source2.cpp
    $ CC source1.o source2.o -o myprogram 
    ```

=== "Fortran"

    ```bash
    $ ftn -c source1.f90
    $ ftn -c source2.f90
    $ ftn source1.o source2.o -o myprogram 
    ```

In the example above, no additional options are provided. However, in most cases
this is not the case and the arguments used with the commands vary according to
which compiler module is loaded. For example, the arguments and options
supported by the GNU Fortran compiler are different from those supported by the
Cray Fortran compiler.

### Wrapper and compiler options

The following flags are a good starting point to achieved good performance:

| Compilers    | Good performance                                  | Aggressive optimizations |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Cray C/C++   | `-O2 -funroll-loops -ffast-math`                  | `-Ofast -funroll-loops`  |
| Cray Fortran | Default                                           | `-O3 -hfp3`              |
| GCC          | `-O2 -ftree-vectorize -funroll-loops -ffast-math` | `-Ofast -funroll-loops`  |

Detailed information about the available compiler options are available here:

- [Cray Compiling Environment][cce]
- [The GNU Compilers][gnu]

The man pages of the wrappers and of the underlying compilers are also a good
place to explore the options. The command to access the man pages are presented
in the table below.

| Language | Wrapper   | CCE           | GNU            |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| C        | `man cc`  | `man craycc`  | `man gcc`      |
| C++      | `man CC`  | `man crayCC`  | `man g++`      |
| Fortran  | `man ftn` | `man crayftn` | `man gfortran` |

### Choosing the target architecture

When using the Cray programming environment, there is no need to specify
compiler flags to target specific CPU architecture, like `-march` and `-mtune`
in gcc. Instead, you load an appropriate combination of modules to choose the
target architecture when compiling. These modules influence the optimizations
performed by the compiler, as well as the libraries (e.g. which BLAS routines
are used in Cray LibSci) used. Therefore, we recommend that you compile with
`craype-x86-milan` for [LUMI-C][lumi-c], even if the compiler optimizations for
Zen 3 processors are immature at the moment.

The table below summarize the available modules.

| Module                    | Target                                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `craype-x86-milan`        | [LUMI-C][lumi-c] CPUs                      |
| `craype-x86-rome`         | [LUMI-D][lumi-d] CPUs, login nodes CPUs    |
| `craype-accel-amd-gfx90a` | [LUMI-G][lumi-g] and [EAP][eap] GPUs       |
| `craype-accel-nvidia75`   | [LUMI-D][lumi-d] GPUs                      |

### Libraries Linking

The wrapper will pass the appropriate linking information to the compiler and
linker for libraries accessible via [modules prefixed by
`cray-`][libraries]. These libraries don't require user-provided options
in order to be linked. For other libraries, the user should provide the
appropriate include (`-I`) and library (`-L`) search paths as well as linking
command (`-l`).

If you have used a Cray system in the past, you may be familiar with the legacy
linking behaviour of the Cray compiler wrappers. Historically, the wrappers
built statically linked executables. In recent versions of the Cray programming
environment, this not the case anymore, libraries are now **dynamically
linked**. The following options are available to you to control the behaviour
of your application

- Follow the default Linux policy and at runtime use the system default version
  of the shared libraries (so may change as and when system is upgraded)
- Hard code the path of each library into the binary at compile time so that a
  specific version is loaded when the application start (as long as the library
  is still installed). Set `CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes` at compile time to use this
  mode.
- Allow the currently loaded programming environment modules to select the
  library version at runtime. Applications must not be linked with
  `CRAY_ADD_RPATH=yes` and must add the following line to the Slurm script:
  ```bash
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ```

Static linking is unsupported by Cray at the moment.

### Using the wrapper with a `configure` script

In order to compile an application that uses a series of `./configure`, `make`,
and `make install` commands, you can pass the compiler wrappers in the
appropriate environment variables. This should be sufficient for a configure
step to succeed.

```bash
$ ./configure CC=cc CXX=CC FC=ftn
```

For other tools, you can try to export environment variables so that the tool
you are using is aware of the wrappers.

=== "C"

    ```bash
    export CC=cc 
    ```

=== "C++"

    ```bash
    export CXX=CC
    ```

=== "Fortran"

    ```bash
    export FC=ftn
    export F77=ftn
    export F90=ftn
    ```

## Compile an MPI Program

When you load a programming environment, the appropriate MPI module is loaded in
the environment (`cray-mpich`). In order to compile your MPI program, you
should use the set of compiler wrappers (`cc`, `CC`, `ftn`). The wrappers
will automatically link codes with the MPI libraries.

If you are using a build system that uses a `configure` script, you may need to
provide the appropriate variables so that the correct wrapper is used.
For example:

```bash
$ ./configure MPICC=cc MPICXX=CC MPIF77=ftn MPIF90=ftn
```

## Compile an OpenMP Program

The table below summarizes the compiler flags used to enable OpenMP for the
different compilers.

| Language | CCE        | GCC        | AOCC       |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| C/C++    | `-fopenmp` | `-fopenmp` | `-fopenmp` |
| Fortran  | `-h omp`   | `-fopenmp` | n.a.       |

When using the OpenMP compiler flag, the wrapper will link to the
[multithreaded version of the Cray libraries][libraries].

## Accessing the programming environment on LUMI

The Cray programming environment can be accessed in three different ways on LUMI:

1. Right after login, ``PrgEnv-cray`` is loaded as most users familiar with
   Cray systems would expect. The set of target modules is not adapted to the
   node that you are on but a set that is safe for the whole system. Users are
   responsible for managing those modules and swapping with an appropriate set.
   Executing ``module purge`` will unload the target modules also and cause
   error messages when you subsequently try to load a programming environment
   as some modules (including ``cray-mpich`` and ``cray-fftw``) can only be
   loaded when a suitable target module is loaded.

2. Working in the ``CrayEnv`` [software stack][softwarestacks]: (Re)-loading
   the ``CrayEnv`` module will (re)set the target modules to an optimal set for
   the node type that you are on. Executing ``module purge`` will also trigger
   a reload of ``CrayEnv``, unless the ``--force`` option is used to unload the
   module.

   The ``CrayEnv`` stack also provides an updated set of build tools and some
   other tools useful to programmers in a way that they cannot conflict with
   tools in the ``LUMI`` software stacks (which is why they are not offered in
   the bare environment).

   We advise users who want to use the Cray programming environment but do not
   need any of the libraries etc. installed in the ``LUMI`` software stacks to
   use the ``CrayEnv`` stack rather than the bare environment.

3. Working in the ``LUMI`` [software stack][softwarestacks]: The ``LUMI``
   software stack offers a range of libraries and packages mostly installed via
   [EasyBuild][easybuild]. It is possible to install additional software on top
   of those stacks using EasyBuild, and use those libraries and tools to
   compile or develop other software outside the EasyBuild environment.

   Each ``LUMI`` stack corresponds to a particular release of the Cray
   programming environment. It is possible to use the ``PrgEnv`` modules in
   this environment. However, EasyBuild requires its own set of modules to
   integrate with the Cray programming environment and we advise users to use
   those instead when working in the ``LUMI`` stack: ``cpeCray`` replaces
   ``PrgEnv-cray``, ``cpeGNU`` replaces ``PrgEnv-gnu``, ``cpeAOCC`` replaces
   ``PrgEnv-aocc`` and ``cpeAMD`` will replace ``PrgEnv-amd`` when that
   environment becomes available on the [LUMI-G][lumi-g] partition. These
   modules also take care of the target architecture modules based on the
   ``partition`` module that is loaded (which offer a way to do cross-compiling
   for another section of LUMI than you are working on).

!!! Remark "Workaround for ``PrgEnv/aocc`` bug in 21.12"
    The ``cpeAOCC/21.12`` in ``LUMI/21.12`` contains a workaround for the
    problems with the ``aocc/3.1.0`` module. Hence it is possible to use
    the AOCC compilers bh working in the ``LUMI/21.12`` stack and using
    ``cpeAOCC/21.12`` rather than loading the ``PrgEnv-aocc`` module.
